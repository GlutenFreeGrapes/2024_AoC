 2024 Advent of Code problems. Not an optimal solution, just the one I found most convenient. 

 Each folder represents the problem for each day (03 = Day 3, 15 = Day 15). Within each folder:
 - [day].py - the code for the solutions to that day's puzzles
 - i.txt, ii.txt, in.txt - examples given by the website
 - input.txt - my personal input from the website
 - other files - outputs
